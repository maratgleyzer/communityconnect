Compare service areas will help the library see how each service area ranks across a range of measures in order to strategically target resources that fit the needs of the local community. In the Performance tab, you can rank each service area in terms of population, patrons, checkouts, open market rate, and potential. In the Customize Data tab you can view specific data sets (e.g., demographic, segmentation, usage) for service areas of your choice.
