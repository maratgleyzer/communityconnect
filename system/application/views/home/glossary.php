	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<p>A cornerstone of success to a public library is a thorough knowledge of its existing and prospective patrons. Market segmentation is a method of obtaining information about the people who live in your community.  CommunityConnect links market segmentation data to information from your library’s ILS in order to help you measure and improve library services. This data-driven approach will help the library better match services, resources, and programs to people’s needs.</p>
	<p>In this sense, market segmentation data is used to predict consumer preferences; and to provide a knowledge-base upon which the library can plan, develop, deliver, and monitor more effective services.   </p>
	<h4>About Market Segmentation</h4>
	<p>The Tapestry market segmentation system developed by ESRI, the world’s leading software and data provider for geographic information systems (GIS), is used by businesses, public sector agencies, and non-profits nationwide. Tapestry organizes every U.S. neighborhood into one of 65 classifications, called segments, based upon their demographic composition, socioeconomic characteristics, housing characteristics, and consumer preferences. Each neighborhood is analyzed and sorted by over 60 data attributes. Using this large and diverse range of data attributes reflects the subtlety and vibrancy of the U.S. marketplace. Data sources include Census 2000 and annual updates, ESRI’s proprietary demographic updates, Acxiom’s InfoBase consumer database, Mediamark Research Inc.’s national consumer survey, and other sources. Any given locale, such as a city, county, or special district, has some subset of the 65 total segments.</p>
	<h4>How Is Tapestry Built?</h4>
	<p>Tapestry combines the traditional statistical methodology of cluster analysis with the latest data mining techniques to provide a robust and compelling segmentation of U.S. neighborhoods. Data mining techniques to complement and strengthen the traditional methodology of working with large amounts of geodemographic data are included.</p>
	<h4>What Verification Steps Are Taken?</h4>
	<p>Verification procedures follow the creation of the segments to ensure their stability and validity. Replicating the segments with independent samples confirms stability. Validity is checked through the use of characteristics not used to generate the segments. Linking the Tapestry segmentation system to the latest consumer survey data is the critical test. A market segmentation system must be able to distinguish consumer behavior—spending patterns and lifestyle choices—as expected.</p>

<div id="demographic" class="tab">
	<p>Demographic data is the basic information collected by the US Census Bureau. CommunityConnect contains two types of demographic data: Census 2000 and the current year estimate of population. Current year estimates of population are provided annually by ESRI. ESRI is the world’s leading GIS software and data provider. Each June, the Census Bureau releases a current year estimate of population for the previous calendar year at the county and metropolitan area levels. For example, in June 2010 the Census Bureau released the current year estimate for the calendar year 2009. ESRI disaggregates the county level data to Census block groups, the most detailed and reliable data available. While Census 2000 will soon be replaced by Census 2010, we have included a limited set of Census 2000 variables that are not available in the current year estimate of population.<p>
