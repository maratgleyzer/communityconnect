<h4>Average</h4>
<p>The middle number of a group of numbers; that is, half the numbers have values that are greater than the median, and half the numbers have values that are less than the median. For example, the median of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 4.</p>

<h4>Average Patron Checkouts</h4>
<p>For a given area (e.g., census block group or service area), the total number of checkouts in that area divided by the number of patrons in the same area.</p>

<h4>Branch</h4>
<p>Library outlets that are part of the Las Vegas Clark County Library District.</p>

<h4>Census Block</h4>
<p>A subdivision of a census tract (or, prior to 2000, a block numbering area), a block is the smallest geographic unit for which the Census Bureau tabulates 100-percent data. Many blocks correspond to individual city blocks bounded by streets, but blocks -- especially in rural areas - may include many square miles and may have some boundaries that are not streets.</p>

<h4>Census Block Group</h4>
<p>A subdivision of a census tract (or, prior to 2000, a block numbering area), a block group is the smallest geographic unit for which the Census Bureau tabulates sample data. A block group consists of all the blocks within a census tract with the same beginning number. Example: block group 3 consists of all blocks within a 2000 census tract numbering from 3000 to 3999.</p>

<h4>Census Tract</h4>
<p>A small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county delineated by a local committee of census data users for the purpose of presenting data. Census tract boundaries normally follow visible features, but may follow governmental unit boundaries and other non-visible features in some instances; they always nest within counties. Designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the time of establishment, census tracts average about 4,000 inhabitants. They may be split by any sub-county geographic entity. Census tracts are divided into block groups and census blocks.</p>

<h4>Checkout Potential</h4>
<p>Ranks the Tapestry segment that has the highest potential for increasing checkouts. The LOWER the rank, the higher the potential. Example: 1 is the highest potential to increase checkouts.</p>

<h4>Checkouts</h4>

<h4>City</h4>

<h4>County</h4>

<h4>Market Potential</h4>
<p>The percent of population that are NOT library cardholders. For example, there are 4,000 people in a census block group of which 1,600 people are NOT patrons. The market potential is 40%.</p>

<h4>Market Share</h4>
<p>The percent of population that are library cardholders. For example, there are 4,000 people in a census block group of which 2,400 people are patrons. The market share is 60%.</p>

<p>The arithmetic mean. It is calculated by adding a group of numbers and then dividing by the count of those numbers. For example, the average of 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, and 10 is 30 divided by 6, which is 5.</p>

<h4>Patron Potential</h4>
<p>Ranks the Tapestry segment that has the highest potential for increasing the number of patrons. The LOWER the rank, the higher the potential. Example: 1 is the highest potential to increase patronage.</p>

<h4>Patrons</h4>
<p>The people who are library cardholders.</p>

<h4>Use Rate</h4>
<p>The share of checkouts for a census block group in a service area. A higher use rate indicates that a census block group has a higher percentage of checkouts in the service area.
