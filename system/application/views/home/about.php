	<h3>CommunityConnect</h3>
	<p>CommunityConnect assists your library better connect with your community. We do this by combining different data sets in an easy to use format so that you can visualize your service area, analyze your community, relate your services to your market, and act to implement change.</p>
	<p>CommunityConnect relates market segmentation data to library data to give you insights into why people are and are not library users; and what their interests and concerns are so you can develop relevant and fitting programs and services tailored specifically to their needs.</p>

	<h3>LiteracyDecision</h3>
	<p>LiteracyDecision is a tool to help your library identify locations which have literacy problems. LiteracyDecision provides a scorecard of socio-economic and demographic problems so you can design programs and services to meet local needs.</p>
