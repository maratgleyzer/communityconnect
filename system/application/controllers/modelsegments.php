Because many of us are first-time homeowners, purchases such as basic household furniture and lawn fertilizer, weed control, and insecticide are important. Vying for attention in the family budget are car loans, student loans, and mortgage payments.<br /><br />We most likely own or lease an SUV or minivan. We enjoy eating out at family restaurants such as Red Robin, Chili's Grill & Bar, and Olive Garden and fast-food restaurants such as Chick-fil-A, Chuck E. Cheese's, and Papa John's.<br /><br />Leisure activities include playing softball, going to the zoo, and visiting theme parks (generally Sea World or Disney World), where we make good use of our digital camera or camcorder. We enjoy renting science fiction, comedy, and family type DVDs. A favorite TV show is 24. Favorite cable stations are Oxygen, E!, and the Discovery Health Channel.
